# UPM
Python codes and example data for Uncertainty Projected Mapping (UPM) 

The main code to generate UPM is the 3_generate_multiple_UPMs.py. 
The remaining two codes help generate this code's required inputs when they are unavailable otherwise. 

There is also a simple flowchart (How to use the codes?.pdf) on how to use the codes. 
Please also find a file named The UPM story.pdf, which I created to provide an easy recap of UPM.

This code is usable for 3D data.
